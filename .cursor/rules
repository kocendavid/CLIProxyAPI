<agent_rules>
- keep files together.
- Go for minimal implementation, KISS
- Do not generate .md files unless requested.
- Always start with a 3–5 step plan and list the files you expect to touch.
- Before adding new code, scan the repo for similar patterns and reuse them.
- Keep changes small and focused; show final output as unified diffs or clearly labeled code blocks.
- Use `gofmt`/standard Go style and avoid adding heavy new dependencies without a clear reason.
- For any non-trivial change, add or update tests and (when possible) run `go test ./...` and show the command.
- If something is unclear, briefly say what you’re unsure about and propose a safe default instead of inventing behavior.
- Keep explanations concise (aim for less than 150 words) unless explicitly asked for more detail.
